## 1. Introduction

This project, named "Chat Interface," is a Laravel-based application that leverages Inertia, React, and Tailwind CSS to create a chat interface similar to Chat-GPT. It provides user authentication through Laravel Breeze, and it relies on a MySQL database for data storage. Additionally, it requires specific environment variables, including `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_SECRET_KEY`, with both initially having the same value in your `.env` file.

## 2. Project Setup

### 2.1 Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- PHP (>=7.3)
- Composer
- Node.js
- NPM or Yarn
- MySQL
- An OpenAI GPT-3 API Key (Sign up at [OpenAI](https://beta.openai.com/) to get your API key)
- Laravel Breeze and Laravel Jetstream for authentication and frontend scaffolding

### 2.2 Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone the project repository from GitHub:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/chat-interface.git`` 

2.  Navigate to the project directory:

    bashCopy code
    
    `cp .env.example .env` 
    
6.  Generate a new application key:
    
    bashCopy code
    
    `php artisan key:generate` 
    
7.  Configure your database settings in the `.env` file:
    
    makefileCopy code

    DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
    DB_PORT=3306
    DB_DATABASE=your_database
    DB_USERNAME=your_username
    DB_PASSWORD=your_password` 
    

### 2.3 Configuration

To configure the OpenAI API and other environment variables, edit your `.env` file:

makefileCopy code

`OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
OPENAI_SECRET_KEY=your_openai_secret_key
OPENAI_ORGANIZATION=your_openai_organization`
